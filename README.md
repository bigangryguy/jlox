# jlox
A Java implementation of the Lox programming language. This is directly from 
Bob Nystrom's site [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/bigangryguy/jlox.git).

## Getting Started
Download the code. It uses fairly basic and generic Java (because I'm not a Java
developer) and was created in IntelliJ IDEA. For a better understanding of the code
itself and the Lox language, read the [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/bigangryguy/jlox.git)
site.

## Contributing
As with all of my simple learning projects, just fork it.
