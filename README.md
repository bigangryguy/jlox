<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A Java implementation of the Lox programming language. This is directly from Bob Nystrom's site [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/bigangryguy/jlox.git).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

None. This will work with Java 8 or higher.

### Installation

Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bigangryguy/jlox.git
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

For now, reference the Lox grammar [appendix](https://craftinginterpreters.com/appendix-i.html) on the Crafting Interpreters site. In the future, as cloxplus adds new 
features and forks from the original language specification, a full grammar reference will be included here.



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/bigangryguy/jlox/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

This is a completion of the project. A continued implementation of the Lox language in C++, with plans for extensions 
to the original language specification, can be found in my [cloxplus](https://github.com/bigangryguy/cloxplus) project.
